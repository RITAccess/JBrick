An accessible Lego Mindstorms NXT programming environment for students and hobbyists.

This project is intended to provide people with a diverse skill set the tools needed to program Lego Mindstorms NXT robots. The language supported is the NXC programing language, which is a textual language. The programming environment will be screen reader compatible and support users with visual impairments as well as sighted users. 

See our demo a student team's robot dancing at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iO83ZsU2WTU.  The program was created using JBrick.
