Developement
-

If you are contributing to the jbricks project on a Windows OS - the lib folder of jbricks contians a AppleJavaExtensions.jar. Add it to the build path (i.e. in Eclipse: right click, Build Path -> Add to Build Path), otherwise the build will have errors referencing Mac OS specific code. 

Running and Testing The Application
-

To run the application you must be using a 32-bit version of Java due to compatability issues with the Fantom driver and 64-bit Java.
