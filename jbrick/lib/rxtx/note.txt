I'm currently using the win32 dll on a win64 machine... havent tested anything but the win32 dll
if you are using a 32bit JVM with a 32 bit version of eclipse, use the win32 dll or you'll get an error loading the dll


To get this to work you might need to right click the rxtx jar and point it to the folder containing the correct rxtx dll.
- the dll does not need to be on the build path
