<h1> Overview </h1>
<p> jBrick was written to add additional features to the BricxCC program. BricxCC doesn't provide support to people who are visually impaired. jBrick provides an alternate way to easily work with the Lego MindStorms robot systems. It is built around NQC (Not Quite C Compiler), written by Dave Baum, that makes it possible to program the NXC brick in a language that is close to C.
</p>

<p>The foundation of jBrick is a full-featured programmer's editor which utilizes SWT in which you can write your programs with the integrated ability to compile the programs and download them to the brick. In case of errors they are reported at the bottom of the editor window such that they can be corrected easily. In addition to providing an editor, jBrick contains tools to control your robot directly (with a Xbox controller or a GUI), and poll the sensor inputs.
</p>

<p>jBrick can be used free of charge. Please note that NQC and it documentation are copyrighted by Dave Baum & John Hansen.
