        <p >jBrick was written to add additional features to the <a
            href="http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/">BricxCC</a> program. BricxCC< doesn&#39t provide support to
        people who are visually impaired. jBrick provides an alternate way to easily
        work with the <a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx">Lego
            MindStorms robot systems</a>. It is built around NQC (Not Quite C Compiler),
        written by Dave Baum, that makes it possible to program the NXC brick in a language
        that is close to C. </p>
        
        <p>The foundation of jBrick is a full-featured programmer's
        editor which utilizes <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/">SWT</a> in which
        you can write your programs with the integrated ability to compile the programs
        and download them to the brick. In case of errors they are reported at the
        bottom of the editor window such that they can be corrected easily. In addition
        to providing an editor, jBrick contains tools to control your robot directly
        (with a Xbox controller or a GUI), and poll the sensor inputs.</p>
        
        <p>A prerequisite to using this program is to be using Windows
        XP, Vista, or 7 and have the Lego Mindstorm NXT driver installed. This driver
        can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.robotc.net/download/nxt/">ROBOTC.net</a>,
        and provides both 64 bit and 32 bit versions.</p>
        
        <p>jBrick can be used free of charge. Please note that NQC and
        it documentation are copyrighted by Dave Baum &amp; John Hansen. </p>
