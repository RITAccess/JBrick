<h1> Tutorial </h1>
<p hspace="10"> Step 1: Write your code in the jBrick editor or for a test program copy, paste the below code.
</p>

<pre>
task main()
{
	int speed = 65;
	int sleep = 1000;
  
	PlayToneEx(2000, 200, 100, false);
   
	OnFwd(OUT_A, speed);
	OnFwd(OUT_C, speed);
	Wait(sleep);
   
	PlayToneEx(2000, 200, 100, false);
   
	OnFwd(OUT_A, speed);
	Off(OUT_C);
	Wait(sleep);
   
	PlayToneEx(2000, 200, 100, false);
   
	OnFwd(OUT_A, speed);
	OnFwd(OUT_C, speed);
	Wait(sleep);
}
</pre>

Step 2: Save the project by going to File -> Save. Name the file and click save. IF you are including previously written files using #include fileName, make sure that you save all your files in the same folder. Otherwise, your program won't compile.
</p>
<p hspace="10">
Step 3: Compile the project by going to Compile -> Compile. If the compile fails, fix the reported errors. The first time you open up JBricks, you're going to need to select a compiler in the Preferences window. Compilers can be found in the JBricks Compilers folder.<br>
    If you are using a PC, the compiler needed is the nbc.exe file.<br>
    If you are using a Mac, the compiler needed is just nbc.
</p>

Step 4: Download the project to the NXT brick by going to Compile -> Download. If the download fails, verify the brick is connected to your computer, turned on, and that the correct drivers are installed. There is a link to the driver download page in the overview section of this help documentation.<br>

<h3 hspace ="5">Basic Functions</h3>
<p hspace="10" vspace="-5">
Basic commands for moving the robot around:<br>
To move forward: OnFwd(OUT_* ports of wheels, speed);<br>
To move backwards: OnRev(OUT_ports of wheels, speed);<br>
To determine the function duration: Wait(time);  (In seconds)<br>
To power off wheels: Off(OUT_ports of wheels);<br>
* ports of wheels: The motors that the Brick is hooked up to<br>
<pre>
task main ()
{
	/* You can place two motors in the same function by typing
    them next to each other */
	OnFwd(OUT_AB, 75);
	Wait(1000);
	// Or, to make it turn, activate just one motor at a time.
	OnRev(OUT_A,75);
	Wait(50);
	OnRev(OUT_B,75);
	Off(OUT_AB);
}

Things to remember:<br>
You always need to have task main(). Otherwise your program won't compile. <br>
Don't forget the semicolon(;) needed at the end of each statement written.
